  <h1>About myself</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a 20-year old university student at the University of Helsinki, where I study Computer & Data Science. I'm originally from Bangladesh, but my family and I moved here in 2005, when I was only around 2 years old.
    Most of my life I've lived in Tampere, but on December 2022, we moved to Helsinki with my girlfriend. I enjoy physical activities and to counteract
    that, I am also a food enthusiast. I consider myself a pretty chill guy and get along with everyone. Below you can read more about my hobbies and interests. On my free-time I enjoy watching movies or tv shows, football, watching sunsets and the occasional night out.
